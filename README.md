# Multiplayer Shooter Game
Hi everyone! This is a game I have made for a school project on trying to learn how to do networking/multiplayer in Unity! This project is nowhere near done, and I am probably not going to work on it anymore, so feel free to fork this! This code was written in `Unity 2020.2.2f1`. All that is in this project is a simple lobby system and a base game (with enemies, a wave system, etc.). I hope you like it!
